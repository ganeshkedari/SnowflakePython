This code uses the Snowflake Python Connector to connect to your Snowflake account and execute a SQL query against a table in your database. It then fetches the results of the query in chunks of a specified size, converts them to a Pandas DataFrame, and saves them to S3 as Parquet files in the specified S3 bucket and prefix. The chunk_size parameter controls the number of rows to fetch per chunk, and can be adjusted to optimize performance based on the size of your dataset and the resources available in your Snowflake and S3 environments.
